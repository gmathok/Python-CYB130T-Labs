# Python-CYB130T-Labs
This repository holds a collection of Python lab assignments designed for my CYB130T (Object-Oriented Scripting Language) course. The labs were meant for me to explore and practice fundamental Python concepts.

Week 1: Intro to Python
	Assignment 1: Write a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
	Assignment 2: Create a program that calculates and prints the sum of two numbers entered by the user.
	Assignment 3: Write a program that takes the user's name as an input and greets them with a personalized message.

Week 2: Python Variables and Data Types
	Assignment 1: Calculate and print the area of a rectangle. Take the length and width as the user's input.
	Assignment 2: Convert the degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius using a formula and print the result.
	Assignment 3: Create a program that calculates the average of three exam scores entered by the user.

Week 3: Python Control Structures
	Assignment 1: Write a program that checks if a given number by the user is even or odd and prints the result.
	Assignment 2: Create a simple calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on user input.
	Assignment 3: Implement a basic guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

Week 4: Python Functions
	Assignment 1: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
	Assignment 2: Create a function that checks if a number is prime or not and returns the result.
	Assignment 3: Build a program that converts between different units (e.g., inches to centimeters, pounds to kilograms) using functions.

Week 5: Python Lists and Data Structures
	Assignment 1: Write a program that finds the maximum and minimum values in a list of numbers.
	Assignment 2: Create a simple to-do list application where users can add, remove, and list tasks.
	Assignment 3: Implement a dictionary-based phonebook program to store and look up contact information.

Week 6: Python String Manipulation
	Assignment 1: Write a program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.
	Assignment 2: Create a program that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome.
	Assignment 3: Build a basic text-based game using string manipulation to generate responses and interact with the user.

Week 7: Python File Handling
	Assignment 1: Write a program to read a text file, count the number of words, and display the word count.
	Assignment 2: Create a program that reads data from a CSV file and performs calculations or analysis on the data.
	Assignment 3: Implement a basic file-based address book where users can add, edit, and retrieve contact information.

Week 8: Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
	Assignment 1: Define a class for a simple bank account with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.
	Assignment 2: Create a class representing a basic calculator with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
	Assignment 3: Build a class hierarchy for geometric shapes (e.g., circle, rectangle) with methods for area and perimeter calculations.

Week 9: Python Libraries and Modules
	Assignment 1: Explore the math module and write a program that calculates trigonometric functions (e.g., sine, cosine).
	Assignment 2: Work with the datetime module to create a program that calculates age based on birthdates.
	Assignment 3: Utilize a third-party library, such as matplotlib or requests, to create a simple data visualization or API request program.

Week 10: Python Exception Handling
	Assignment 1: Write a program that handles exceptions when dividing by zero.
	Assignment 2: Create a program that reads data from a file and handles file not found exceptions.
	Assignment 3: Build a simple error-handling mechanism for a calculator program to handle invalid inputs.

Week 11: Final Review and Projects
	Assignment 1: Review and improve any previous assignments or labs.
	Assignment 2: Work on a more complex Python project that integrates multiple concepts you've learned.
	Assignment 3: Build a program or tool that solves a real-world problem using Python.
